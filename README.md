# Non-stationary Storm Surge Indicator (NSSI)

This package includes source codes/scripts for developing and analyzing of storm surge climatology (SSC) indicator, which were developed in MATLAB 2017b. â€‹This estimates storm surge climatology (SSC) indicator from tide gauge hourly sea level data. SSC indicator is the return sea level (e.g. 100 year) estimated by fitting a quasi non-stationary extreme value model to seasonal (i.e. two halves of the year: summer and winter) maximum sea levels. Software includes different functions/scripts written in MATLAB language. This also include a "ReadMe.txt" file for further details and to run the software.
